# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java, utilizing Swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database backend.

## Delete Functionality

The delete function allows users to remove existing book records from the library database. Here's how it works:

1. **User Interface**: The GUI provides a table displaying all the available books in the library. Users can select a book they want to delete by clicking on its entry in the table.

2. **Delete Button**: Upon clicking the "Delete" button, the application triggers a delete query in the database, removing the selected book based on its ISBN.

3. **Feedback**: After the delete operation is completed, the system displays a message dialog confirming the successful deletion.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (GUI Toolkit)
